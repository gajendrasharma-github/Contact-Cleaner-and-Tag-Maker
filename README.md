# Contact-Cleaner-and-Tag-Maker
A personal project to clean and tag the messy contacts list utilizing pandas data cleaning abilities.

The project involves cleaning and organizing my contact list, specifically by normalizing phone numbers and adding tags for easier searching. The project reflects a practical application of Python skills to address a personal challenge, emphasizing the value of using what I've learned to solve real-world problems.

### Project Description
In the age of rapid technological advancement, it's easy to get caught up in building complex models and projects. Yet, we often overlook how these powerful tools can be applied to our own lives to solve everyday problems. In this project, I took a step back from the typical machine learning tasks and used Python to tackle a simple yet frustrating problem: organizing my messy contact list. By cleaning and tagging my contacts, I demonstrated that even small-scale, personal projects can have a significant impact. This project is a testament to my holistic learning approachâ€”applying knowledge not just in theory, but in practical, personalized ways. In that sense, **I am a generalized machine learning model**, capable of solving diverse challenges, including the ones I face in my daily life, by learning the patterns of solving problems.

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving the Problem

1. **Data Collection:**
   - I exported my contact list from Google Contacts into a CSV file. This file contained various fields, including phone numbers stored in inconsistent formats.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
     - I created a function to clean up the phone numbers by removing characters like `+`, `-`, and spaces. This ensured all phone numbers were in a consistent format.
     - I identified phone numbers that were still not standardized in length and adjusted them accordingly, ensuring uniformity across the dataset.

3. **Tagging Contacts:**
   - After cleaning the phone numbers, I added tags to the contact names to make searching more intuitive. These tags were based on categories such as location, relationship, or type of contact (e.g., work, personal).
   - This tagging system allowed me to easily filter and find contacts based on specific criteria, which was the ultimate goal of the project.

4. **Verification and Testing:**
   - I tested the cleaned and tagged contact list to ensure that the tags were meaningful and the phone numbers were correctly standardized.
   - Any inconsistencies were further refined, resulting in a clean, well-organized contact list.

5. **Implementation:**
   - The final step was to re-upload the cleaned and tagged contact list back into my phone, making the contact search process significantly more efficient.

### Conclusion

By applying Python to clean and tag my contacts, I turned a mundane task into a streamlined process. This project serves as a reminder that the tools we learn can be just as valuable for solving personal problems as they are for professional or academic purposes.
